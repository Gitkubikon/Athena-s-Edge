Sure! Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up the development stack you've mentioned:

Front-end Setup
---------------

1.  Install Node.js

The first step is to install Node.js, which is required to run the development server and build tools. You can download the latest version from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

2.  Create a new Svelte project

Once Node.js is installed, open a terminal window and run the following command to create a new Svelte project:


```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template my-svelte-app
```

This will create a new Svelte project in a directory named ```my-svelte-app```.

3.  Install Vite

Next, install Vite as a development dependency by running the following command in the project directory:


```bash
npm install --save-dev vite
```

4.  Configure Vite

Create a new file named ```vite.config.ts``` in the project root directory and add the following code:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'; import svelte from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte';  export default defineConfig({   plugins: [svelte()], });
```

This configures Vite to use the Svelte plugin, which enables Svelte support in the build process.

5.  Install TypeScript

To use TypeScript in the project, install it as a development dependency by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @rollup/plugin-typescript
```

6.  Configure TypeScript

Create a new file named ```tsconfig.json``` in the project root directory and add the following code:

```json
{   "compilerOptions": {     "target": "es2019",     "module": "esnext",     "strict": true,     "esModuleInterop": true,     "resolveJsonModule": true,     "sourceMap": true,     "skipLibCheck": true,     "noEmit": true,     "lib": ["es2019", "dom"]   },   "include": ["src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.d.ts"] }
```

This configures TypeScript to target the ECMAScript 2019 standard, enable strict type checking, and use ES modules.

7.  Install Tailwind CSS

To use Tailwind CSS in the project, install it as a development dependency by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```

8.  Configure Tailwind CSS

Create a new file named ```postcss.config.js``` in the project root directory and add the following code:

```javascript
module.exports = {   plugins: {     tailwindcss: {},     autoprefixer: {},   }, };
```

Create a new file named ```tailwind.config.js``` in the project root directory and add the following code:

```javascript
module.exports = {   purge: ['./src/**/*.html', './src/**/*.svelte'],   darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'   theme: {     extend: {},   },   variants: {},   plugins: [], };
```

This configures Tailwind CSS to use the default configuration with purging enabled.

9.  Install Jest

To use Jest for testing, install it as a development dependency by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest svelte-jester
```

10.  Configure Jest (Continued)

```javascript
module.exports = {   preset: 'ts-jest',   transform: {     '^.+\\.svelte$': 'svelte-jester',     '^.+\\.ts$': 'ts-jest',   },   moduleFileExtensions: ['js', 'ts', 'svelte'],   setupFilesAfterEnv: ['@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect'],   bail: false,   verbose: true, };
```

This configures Jest to use the TypeScript preset, transform Svelte and TypeScript files, and use the Jest DOM extension library for testing.

Back-end Setup
--------------

1.  Create a Firebase Project

To use Firebase as the database for the project, create a new Firebase project by following the instructions on the Firebase website: [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

2.  Install Firebase

To use Firebase in the project, install it as a dependency by running the following command:

```bash
npm install firebase
```

3.  Configure Firebase

Create a new file named ```firebase.js``` in the project root directory and add the following code:

```javascript
import firebase from 'firebase/app'; import 'firebase/database';  const firebaseConfig = {   // Your firebase config here };  firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);  const db = firebase.database();  export default db;
```

Replace the ```firebaseConfig``` object with your own Firebase project configuration.

4.  Install PayloadCMS

To use PayloadCMS as the CMS for the project, install it as a dependency by running the following command:

```bash
npm install payloadcms
```

5.  Configure PayloadCMS

Create a new file named ```payload.js``` in the project root directory and add the following code:

```javascript
import { createClient } from 'payload'; import db from './firebase';  export default createClient({   apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',   admin: {     firebase: db.ref('payload/cms'),   }, });
```

Replace ```YOUR_API_KEY``` with your own PayloadCMS API key.

6.  Install Express.js

To use Express.js as the server for the project, install it as a dependency by running the following command:

```bash
npm install express
```

7.  Create the Server

Create a new file named ```server.js``` in the project root directory and add the following code:

```javascript
import express from 'express'; import payload from './payload';  const app = express(); const port = 3000;  app.use('/cms', payload.express);  app.listen(port, () => {   console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`); });
```

This configures Express.js to use PayloadCMS and listen on port 3000.

8.  Start the Server

Start the server by running the following command in the project directory:

```bash
node server.js
```

This will start the server and make the PayloadCMS API available at ```http://localhost:3000/cms```.

And that's it! You now have a full development stack set up with Svelte, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Jest, Firebase, PayloadCMS, Express.js, and JavaScript. You can start building your website using this stack and take advantage of the performance and productivity benefits of each tool.
